### Create a New OIDC App in Okta

To create a new OIDC app on Okta:

1. Log in to your developer account (or [create a free one](https://developer.okta.com/signup).
2. Navigate to **Applications**, and click on **Add Application**.
3. Select **Single-Page App** and click **Next**. 
4. Give the application a name, change all instances of `http://localhost:8080` to `http://localhost:3000` and click **Done**.

Set your `issuer` and copy the `clientId` in to `src/app/app.module.ts`. 

**NOTE:** The value of `{yourOktaDomain}` should be something like `dev-123456.okta.com`. Make sure you don't include `-admin` in the value!

```js
const config = {
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  redirect_uri: window.location.origin + '/implicit/callback',
  client_id: '{yourClientId}',
  pkce: true
};
```
